### Types of Vulnerability Scans

Vulnerability scans are typically configured based on a scan policy set in automated scanning tools. These policies can help target specific types of vulnerabilities or limit potential disruptions. Here’s a breakdown of common vulnerability scan types:

1. **Unauthenticated Scans**  
   - **Description**: These scans do not require login credentials to access the system. They simulate an outsider’s perspective, identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for assessing public-facing systems and testing security posture against external threats.
   - **Limitations**: Limited in scope as they cannot access resources restricted to authenticated users.

2. **Authenticated Scans**  
   - **Description**: These scans use credentials to gain access to the system, allowing for a deeper inspection of internal resources and vulnerabilities. They provide more comprehensive coverage by simulating an insider threat or a compromised user account.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for internal security assessments to identify configuration issues, missing patches, and other vulnerabilities within the system.
   - **Limitations**: Requires valid credentials and may require special access permissions.

3. **Discovery Scans**  
   - **Description**: This type of scan is designed to identify active devices, services, and open ports within a network without performing in-depth vulnerability detection. It’s typically a lightweight scan focused on asset inventory.
   - **Use Case**: Often used at the beginning of an assessment to understand the network layout and discover active hosts.
   - **Limitations**: Limited to identifying active assets and cannot provide detailed vulnerability information.

4. **Full Scans**  
   - **Description**: Full scans run all available checks and techniques on the target system, performing an extensive vulnerability assessment.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for comprehensive vulnerability assessment when testing a non-production environment or scheduled maintenance window.
   - **Limitations**: Can be time-consuming and may impact system performance; not ideal for sensitive or production systems due to the risk of disruption.

5. **Stealth Scans**  
   - **Description**: Stealth scans are designed to be low-profile, minimizing the likelihood of detection by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for security testing where minimal disturbance and detection are desired, such as when testing IDS or observing reactions to intrusion attempts.
   - **Limitations**: Often slower and may miss some vulnerabilities due to limitations on aggressive scanning techniques.

6. **Compliance Scans**  
   - **Description**: These scans assess a system’s compliance with specific regulatory standards, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR. They focus on identifying vulnerabilities and configurations that could lead to compliance violations.
   - **Use Case**: Used in environments that must adhere to regulatory requirements to ensure compliance and avoid penalties.
   - **Limitations**: Focused on compliance rather than comprehensive vulnerability discovery, and may miss issues not directly related to the compliance framework.

### Implementing Vulnerability Scans

Each type of vulnerability scan has specific use cases, and scanning tools often provide options to customize scan policies for different scenarios. For example:

- **Nessus**: Allows users to configure scan types (e.g., discovery, authenticated, or compliance) through a flexible policy editor.
- **OpenVAS**: Provides predefined scan types and lets users adjust scan intensity and detection levels.
- **Qualys**: Offers scan profiles tailored for compliance and vulnerability management, with adjustable options for different environments.

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It is commonly used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network. Nmap is also used for vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses in networks and systems. 

#### **Types of Nmap Scans**
Nmap supports several types of scans that can help in vulnerability assessment:

1. **TCP Connect Scan** (`-sT`): 
   - Establishes a full TCP connection with the target. It is less stealthy, but it is reliable.
   
2. **SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)** (`-sS`):
   - Only sends SYN packets and waits for the response. If it gets a SYN-ACK, the port is open. It is stealthier than the TCP Connect Scan.
   
3. **UDP Scan** (`-sU`):
   - Sends UDP packets to target ports to determine if they are open. It is slower than TCP scanning because UDP does not have the same handshake process.
   
4. **Service Version Detection** (`-sV`):
   - Scans for the versions of services running on open ports. This can reveal vulnerabilities tied to specific software versions.

5. **Operating System Detection** (`-O`):
   - Identifies the target operating system by analyzing the response to specific packets sent to the target.
   
6. **Vulnerability Scanning** (`--script`):
   - Nmap’s **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)** allows you to run scripts that can detect various vulnerabilities. For example, using the command `nmap --script=vuln [target]` will run vulnerability scripts to identify issues like Heartbleed, SMB vulnerabilities, etc.

#### **Nmap Vulnerability Scanning Example**
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O --script=vuln [target-ip]
```
This command performs:
- A SYN scan (`-sS`)
- Version detection (`-sV`)
- OS detection (`-O`)
- Runs vulnerability scripts (`--script=vuln`)

**How to Implement Nmap Scanning:**
1. Install Nmap: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nmap
   ```
2. Perform a basic scan:
   ```bash
   nmap [target-ip]
   ```
3. Use advanced vulnerability scanning:
   ```bash
   nmap --script=vuln [target-ip]
   ```

### Challenges to Consider When Running a Vulnerability Scan

When planning and performing vulnerability scans, there are several challenges to consider to ensure effective scanning without compromising the target environment. Below is an expansion of the key considerations:

---

#### **1. Considering the Best Time to Run a Scan**
- **Production vs. Lab Environments**: Scanning in production environments requires careful planning, as it can generate significant network traffic and potentially disrupt operations. Lab environments typically lack these concerns.
- **Network Traffic Impact**: Scans produce network noise, which can lead to congestion, especially across multiple network hops.
- **System/Service Crashes**: Aggressive scanning techniques or plugins may crash target devices or network infrastructure.
- **Recommended Timing**: Schedule scans during off-peak hours (e.g., early morning) to minimize disruptions.

---

#### **2. Determining What Protocols Are in Use**
- **Importance of Protocol Awareness**: Many devices use both TCP and UDP for different services. Failing to scan all active protocols can lead to missed vulnerabilities.
- **Thorough Coverage**: Ensure scans cover both TCP and UDP ports to avoid blind spots in vulnerability detection.

---

#### **3. Network Topology**
- **Proximity to Target**: Place the scanner as close to the target as possible to reduce traffic traversal and minimize the impact on intermediary devices.
- **Avoiding WAN Scans**: Scanning across WAN links is discouraged due to the potential for significant disruption and skewed results.
- **Firewall and Device Traversal**: Traversing firewalls or other devices can filter or alter traffic, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate scan results.

---

#### **4. Bandwidth Limitations**
- **Bandwidth Impact**: Scans can saturate network bandwidth, especially in low-bandwidth environments or across VPN/WAN links.
- **Settings Adjustment**: Reduce the volume of traffic or scope of the scan to prevent excessive bandwidth consumption.
- **Denial-of-Service Concerns**: Disable or limit DoS-related plugins to avoid accidental disruption.

---

#### **5. Query Throttling**
- **Reducing Traffic Intensity**: Adjust scanning policies to throttle queries by:
  - Limiting the number of simultaneous attack threads.
  - Narrowing the scope of plugins based on the target’s known configuration (e.g., disabling Windows-specific plugins for Linux systems).
- **Improving Target Response**: A more controlled scan reduces the risk of crashing fragile systems and ensures smoother operations.

---

#### **6. Fragile Systems/Nontraditional Assets**
- **Sensitivity of Fragile Systems**: Certain systems may be highly sensitive to scans, risking crashes or operational issues.
- **Nontraditional Devices**: Internet of Things (IoT) devices, medical equipment, or embedded systems may require specialized scanning techniques.
- **Custom Scans**: Use tailored policies that exclude aggressive tests and focus on lightweight scanning methods to avoid overwhelming such assets.
