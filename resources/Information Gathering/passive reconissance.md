# Passive Reconnaissance

## Overview

**Passive reconnaissance** is a crucial initial step in penetration testing, where the tester gathers intelligence about the target without directly engaging with it. The aim is to remain undetected while collecting valuable information that may reveal potential weaknesses in the target’s infrastructure.

Unlike active reconnaissance, passive methods rely on publicly available data and third-party resources, ensuring that the target remains unaware of the tester’s activities. This phase provides valuable insights into the target’s digital footprint, technologies used, employees, and more.

## Why Use Passive Reconnaissance?

- **Stealth**: Since there is no direct interaction with the target, passive reconnaissance activities are undetectable by standard security measures.
- **Context Building**: Collects external data to provide context about the target’s security posture before active testing.
- **Reduced Risk**: Avoids triggering alarms in intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

## Tools for Passive Reconnaissance

### 1. **OSINT Framework**

The [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) is an open-source project that organizes free online resources for conducting open-source intelligence. It provides a structured collection of tools for gathering information on IP addresses, domain names, social media accounts, and much more.

#### Key Features:
- Organized tree-based structure.
- Links to hundreds of OSINT tools and services.
- Focus on passive reconnaissance without engaging the target.

**Example Categories in OSINT Framework**:
- Domain name lookups
- Email address searches
- IP geolocation
- Social media profiling

### 2. **SpiderFoot**

**SpiderFoot** is an automated reconnaissance tool that scans a wide range of public sources for information on IP addresses, domains, emails, names, and more. It integrates with various APIs and databases, offering both passive and active reconnaissance capabilities.

#### Key Features:
- Fully automated OSINT collection.
- Integrates with over 100 data sources.
- Can be used for infrastructure intelligence and threat detection.

#### SpiderFoot Installation on Kali Linux:

**Step 1: Install SpiderFoot**:

SpiderFoot is available as a Docker image or via `pip` for manual installation.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install spiderfoot
```

**Step 2: Start the SpiderFoot Web Interface:**

Once installed, run SpiderFoot with the following command to launch the web-based GUI on Kali:

```bash
spiderfoot -l 127.0.0.1:5001
```
You can access the GUI via your browser at http://localhost:5001.

**SpiderFoot API Integration:**
SpiderFoot can be integrated into a larger automated OSINT process via its REST API. Below is an example of initiating a scan using the API in Python:

```python
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:5001/start_scan"
data = {
    'target': 'example.com',
    'modules': 'all'
}

response = requests.post(api_url, data=data)
print(response.json())
```
