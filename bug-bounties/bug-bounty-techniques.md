# Bug Bounty Techniques

## Overview

Bug bounty programs offer a unique opportunity for security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities in systems in exchange for rewards. This file provides an overview of various techniques and methodologies used in bug bounty hunting.

## Common Techniques

### 1. Reconnaissance
- **Active Recon**: Tools and techniques for active information gathering, such as Nmap, Nikto, and vulnerability scanners.
- **Passive Recon**: Gathering information without direct interaction, using tools like WHOIS lookups, Google Dorking, and public databases.

### 2. Web Application Testing
- **SQL Injection**: Techniques to test and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Methods to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities.

### 3. Network Testing
- **Port Scanning**: Using tools like Nmap to identify open ports and services.
- **Service Enumeration**: Identifying and probing services running on open ports.

### 4. Exploitation
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Techniques to exploit identified vulnerabilities using Metasploit, Burp Suite, and custom scripts.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Methods to escalate privileges on compromised systems.

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Burp Suite**: Comprehensive web vulnerability scanner.
- **Nmap**: Network scanning and reconnaissance tool.
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner.
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework.

## Best Practices

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Always follow responsible disclosure guidelines when reporting vulnerabilities.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest security news, tools, and techniques.
- **Continuous Learning**: Regularly update your skills and knowledge through courses, webinars, and practice.
