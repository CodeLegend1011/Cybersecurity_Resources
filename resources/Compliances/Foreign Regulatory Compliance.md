This document provides an overview of critical foreign regulatory frameworks for ensuring compliance in cybersecurity, focusing on laws and standards that apply to international and cross-border operations.

## International Regulatory Frameworks

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
The **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that governs the protection and privacy of personal data. It applies to any organization that processes the personal data of EU citizens.

**Key Provisions:**
- Data Subject Rights: Individuals have the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data.
- Lawful Basis for Processing: Data processing must be based on consent, contractual necessity, or other valid reasons.
- Data Protection Officer (DPO): Organizations that handle significant amounts of personal data must appoint a DPO to oversee compliance.

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
The **PCI DSS** is an international security standard that ensures organizations handling credit card information maintain a secure environment.

**Key Requirements:**
- Build and maintain a secure network.
- Protect cardholder data through encryption and other security measures.
- Implement strong access control measures and monitor all network activity.

### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
While **HIPAA** is a U.S. law, its standards for protecting health information have influenced global best practices, especially for companies doing business with U.S. healthcare providers.

**Key Components:**
- Privacy Rule: Protects personal health information.
- Security Rule: Secures electronic protected health information.
- Breach Notification Rule: Mandates notification in the event of a data breach.

### Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
**FedRAMP** is a U.S.-based program that impacts global companies working with U.S. federal agencies by providing standardized security assessment, authorization, and monitoring of cloud services.

**Key Elements:**
- Requires cloud service providers to meet stringent security standards.
- Mandates continuous monitoring of cloud services used by federal agencies.

A Canadian law governing data privacy and protection for businesses.

#### China’s Cybersecurity Law
A law requiring companies to store user data within China's borders and comply with strict government oversight on data security.

#### Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD)
Similar to GDPR, Brazil’s **LGPD** governs the processing of personal data for individuals within Brazil.
