# Information Gathering and Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview

Information gathering, or **reconnaissance**, is the first phase in the penetration testing process, where a tester collects information about a target system to understand its structure and weaknesses. It can be divided into:

- **Reconnaissance**
- **Scanning**
- **Enumeration**

### 1. Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the act of gathering preliminary information about the target system. It helps in discovering open ports, network vulnerabilities, software versions, and other relevant information.

There are two types of reconnaissance:
- **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gathering information without directly interacting with the target.
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Directly interacting with the target system to gather information.

For detailed information on **Passive Reconnaissance**, refer to [passive_reconnaissance.md](passive_reconnaissance.md).

For detailed information on **Active Reconnaissance**, refer to [active_reconnaissance.md](active_reconnaissance.md).


### 2. Scanning

Scanning involves actively probing the target to detect open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. Common tools include:
- **Nmap**: For network mapping and port scanning.
- **Nessus**: For vulnerability scanning.
- **OpenVAS**: For open-source vulnerability assessments.

### 3. Enumeration

Enumeration goes deeper into the system, retrieving more detailed information such as usernames, shared resources, and network structure. This step is typically more aggressive than scanning.
