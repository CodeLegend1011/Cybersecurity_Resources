# Passive Reconnaissance

## Overview

**Passive reconnaissance** is a crucial initial step in penetration testing, where the tester gathers intelligence about the target without directly engaging with it. The aim is to remain undetected while collecting valuable information that may reveal potential weaknesses in the target’s infrastructure.

Unlike active reconnaissance, passive methods rely on publicly available data and third-party resources, ensuring that the target remains unaware of the tester’s activities. This phase provides valuable insights into the target’s digital footprint, technologies used, employees, and more.

## Why Use Passive Reconnaissance?

- **Stealth**: Since there is no direct interaction with the target, passive reconnaissance activities are undetectable by standard security measures.
- **Context Building**: Collects external data to provide context about the target’s security posture before active testing.
- **Reduced Risk**: Avoids triggering alarms in intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

## Tools for Passive Reconnaissance

### 1. **OSINT Framework**

The [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/) is an open-source project that organizes free online resources for conducting open-source intelligence. It provides a structured collection of tools for gathering information on IP addresses, domain names, social media accounts, and much more.

#### Key Features:
- Organized tree-based structure.
- Links to hundreds of OSINT tools and services.
- Focus on passive reconnaissance without engaging the target.

**Example Categories in OSINT Framework**:
- Domain name lookups
- Email address searches
- IP geolocation
- Social media profiling

### 1. **SpiderFoot**

**SpiderFoot** is a powerful OSINT tool used to automate the process of gathering intelligence from multiple public sources about a target. It supports integration with more than 100 data sources, including domain names, IP addresses, email addresses, and more.

#### Key Features:
- Extensive OSINT collection from over 100 sources.
- Fully automated reconnaissance tool with a web-based interface.
- Capable of identifying potential vulnerabilities without interacting with the target.

#### SpiderFoot Installation on Kali Linux:

**Step 1: Install SpiderFoot**:

SpiderFoot is available as a Docker image or via `pip` for manual installation.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install spiderfoot
```

**Step 2: Start the SpiderFoot Web Interface**:

Once installed, run SpiderFoot with the following command to launch the web-based GUI on Kali:

```bash
spiderfoot -l 127.0.0.1:5001
```

You can access the GUI via your browser at `http://localhost:5001`.

#### SpiderFoot API Integration:

SpiderFoot can be integrated into a larger automated OSINT process via its REST API. Below is an example of initiating a scan using the API in Python:

```python
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:5001/start_scan"
data = {
    'target': 'example.com',
    'modules': 'all'
}

response = requests.post(api_url, data=data)
print(response.json())
```

### 2. **Recon-ng**

**Recon-ng** is a powerful reconnaissance framework modeled after Metasploit. It automates the process of gathering information through various modules, allowing for efficient OSINT collection.

#### Key Features:
- Modular design to add/remove OSINT sources.
- Simple command-line interface.
- API support for data sources like Shodan, Google, and Twitter.

#### Recon-ng Installation and Usage on Kali Linux:

**Step 1: Install Recon-ng**:

Recon-ng comes pre-installed in Kali Linux. If you need to update or install it:

```bash
sudo apt install recon-ng
```

**Step 2: Start Recon-ng**:

```bash
recon-ng
```

**Step 3: Create a Workspace**:

Workspaces help organize different reconnaissance tasks:

```bash
workspace create target_recon
```

**Step 4: Running a Module**:

You can search for and run modules to gather information. For example, using the `whois_poc` module to gather whois information about a target domain:

```bash
modules load recon/domains-hosts/whois_poc
set SOURCE example.com
run
```

### 3. **theHarvester**

**theHarvester** is a simple yet effective tool for gathering email addresses, subdomains, IPs, and URLs using search engines and public sources. It's commonly used to enumerate potential attack vectors.

#### Key Features:
- Collects data from search engines like Google, Bing, and more.
- Can gather email addresses, subdomains, and other information quickly.

#### Installation and Usage:

**Step 1: Install theHarvester**:

theHarvester comes pre-installed in Kali Linux. To install it manually or update:

```bash
sudo apt install theharvester
```

**Step 2: Run theHarvester**:

```bash
theHarvester -d example.com -l 500 -b google
```

This command will search Google for the domain `example.com` and return up to 500 results.

### 4. **Maltego**

**Maltego** is a sophisticated graphical link analysis tool that connects data from numerous sources to reveal relationships between people, domains, email addresses, and more. It’s ideal for visualizing connections during OSINT operations.

#### Key Features:
- Visual link analysis tool for connecting entities like domains, people, and emails.
- Integrates with numerous data sources for thorough OSINT.
- Graph-based interface for easy pattern recognition.

#### Installation and Usage:

Maltego can be installed and run on Kali Linux using:

```bash
sudo apt install maltego
```

You will need to register for an account and log in to the interface to start visualizing data. Maltego transforms data into a graphical representation that helps in identifying patterns and connections across the gathered data.

### 5. **Shodan**

**Shodan** is an invaluable search engine for finding devices connected to the internet. It helps gather information about servers, IoT devices, cameras, and other internet-exposed services.

#### Key Features:
- Search for devices and services exposed to the internet.
- Explore open ports, services, and technologies used by targets.
- Provides APIs for automation.

#### Shodan on Kali Linux:

While Shodan doesn’t have a direct installation, you can use the **Shodan API** in Python for passive reconnaissance:

```bash
pip install shodan
```

#### Shodan API Example:

```python
import shodan

api = shodan.Shodan('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Search for open ports or services on a target IP
results = api.search('example.com')

for result in results['matches']:
    print(f"IP: {result['ip_str']}, Port: {result['port']}, Data: {result['data']}")
```
